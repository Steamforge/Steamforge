Engineering Manager, Instructor and Web Developer with over 20 years experience. I lead teams to help build high profile websites for clients such as Facebook. I built high traffic sites for MotorTrend, Kelley Blue Book and the OC Register. My passion for mentoring led me to teach full-stack developer classes for UCI and UCLA. When I'm not building websites, I'm building websites.
